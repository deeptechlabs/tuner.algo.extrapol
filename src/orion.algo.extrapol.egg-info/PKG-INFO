Description: # Extrapolating Learning Curves of Deep Neural Networks
        
        By Tobias Domhan, Jost Tobias Springenberg, and Frank Hutter, 2014.
        
        Experienced human experts in deep learning commonly rely on a large “bag of tricks” to
        determine model hyperparameters (Bengio, 2012), as well as learning rates for stochastic
        gradient descent (SGD) (LeCun et al., 1998; Bottou, 2012). Using this acquired knowledge
        they can often tell after a few SGD iterations whether the training procedure will converge
        to a model with competitive performance or not. To save time, they then prematurely
        terminate runs expected to perform poorly. Automating this manual trick would be valuable
        for speeding up both structure search (Bergstra et al., 2011, 2013; Swersky et al., 2013) and
        hyperparameter optimization (Snoek et al., 2012; Eggensperger et al., 2013), which are
        currently often prohibitively expensive (Krizhevsky et al., 2012).
        We take a first step towards this goal by studying methods for extrapolating from
        the first part of a learning curve to its remainder. Preliminary results indicate that such
        predictions can be quite accurate and enable the early termination of poor runs.
